# systemd for OpenWrt

An experimental, unholy union of [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) and [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/). Yes, it runs on a [VoCore](http://vocore.io/), which is about the size of an American quarter.


## Requirements

<img src=http://vocore.io/images/1412416257_IMG_7891.jpg align=right hspace=15 vspace=15>

- You must use eglibc as your C library, as systemd requires (e)glibc and will not work with uClibc!

- I have included some supporting OpenWrt patches for things we depend on that are not available in OpenWrt yet, including:
  - `openwrt-kernel-config.patch` adds OpenWrt kernel config options required by systemd ([originally](https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2014-March/024291.html) by openwrt-systemd creator, Adam Porter)
  - `openwrt-base-files.patch` avoids some conflicts between `base-files` and `systemd`


## Getting Started

- Add the following to `feeds.conf.default`:

```
src-git systemd https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-systemd.git
```

- Run:

```
./scripts/feeds update systemd
./scripts/feeds install systemd
make menuconfig
```

- Enable "Advanced configuration options (for developers)" and navigate into that menu.

- Enable "Toolchain options" and navigate into that menu.

- Under "C Library implementation", choose "eglibc".

- At the top of the menu tree, under "Base system", you'll find the "systemd" package, and lots of goodies under it!
